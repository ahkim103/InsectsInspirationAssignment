        <h1>What Are Locusts?</h1>
        <p>Locusts are large insects (Class Insecta) that belong to the Order Orthoptera,
            which houses similar creatures including grasshoppers and crickets.</p>

                <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Locusts are invertebretes, herbivores, and look very similar to grasshoppers with 
                    their big hind legs. They are about 0.5-3 inches tall (about 1 paper clip) and 
                    weight roughly 0.07 ounces (about 2 paper clips).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info_col">
                <h3>Behavior/Life Cycle</h3>
                <p>Locusts experience two behaviors, solitary and gregarious, and can shift from one 
                    behavior to another. On hatching, a locust emerges wingless as a nonflying nymph, 
                    which can be either solitary or gregarious. A nymph can also change between 
                    behavior phases before becoming a flying adult after 24 to 95 days.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info_col">
                <h3>Location</h3>
                <p>Locusts and by extention swarms are typically found in Northern Africa, 
                    most of South Eurasia, East Indies, Middle East, Australia 
                    and New Zealand. It even has appeared in the USA sometimes.</p>

                <h3>Locusts vs Grasshoppers</h3>
                <p>Grasshoppers live completely solitary lives while locusts can change 
                    and live in swarms. Depending on the season, locusts can either be 
                    larger/smaller and stronger/weaker than grasshoppers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info_col">
                <h3>Locust Swarms</h3>
                <p>One swarm can have around 80 million locusts, with a swarm of this size 
                    being able to eat over 400 million pounds of plants in a single day. 
                    Locust swarms are also able to travel great distances. One swarm in the 
                    1950s flew all the way from northwest Africa to Great Britain.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info_col">
                <h3>Why Locusts Are A Problem</h3>
                <p>Locust swarms are extremely devastating by destorying agriculture and 
                    devouring crops. For example, the desert locust can at times affect 
                    approximately 20% of the world’s land surface.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h1>How Do The Swarms Happen?</h1>
        <p>During dry seasons with low precipitation, locusts (solitary) huddle in packs in 
            areas with vegetation. When rain comes, they produce rapidly become more crowded,
            shifting their behavior to gregarious. Not only can even change color and body shape 
            when they move into this phase, but thheir endurance increases and their brains 
            get larger.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Can We Prevent The Swarms?</h1>
        <p>It's very difficult to manage swarms of locusts due to many reasons including the 
            remoteness and breadth of the areas across which they’re spread and limited resources 
            in some of the affected countries. Some experts worry that locust plagues will worsen 
            in a warming world. Rising sea temperatures are causing prolonged bouts of wet weather, 
            including a surge of rare cyclones in eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where 
            desert locusts thrive.</p>
