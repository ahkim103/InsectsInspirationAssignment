        <h1>How Are Locusts Usually Depicted In General Media?</h1>
        <p>Locusts have typically represented greed and destruction in books, movies, and even religion.</p>

        <p>
            The Bone Series (Jeff Smith) was one of my favorite comic book series that 
            I have read when I was young due to its interesting story and unique characters.
            In this series, the main overarching antagonist is referred to as The Lord of the 
            Locusts, or simply The Locust. The Locust is a nightmarish spirit without any shape
            or form that wanted to become part of the physical world. To do this, he needed to 
            possess the body of a mortal, which he eventually decided on Mim, the queen of the 
            dragons who kept all life in perfect balance. Once The Locust possessed Mim, she went
            mad, causing the balance to crumble. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To save the world, the dragons reluctantly rebelled and battled against Mim, claiming many
            of their lives. With no other option, the dragons were forced to turn her into stone and 
            entomb her beneath the earth, trapping the Locust in her. The land in which the battle 
            had took place, would come to be known as the Valley, where the main story takes place.
            Although The Locust himself is not present until much later in the series, he influences
            a lot of what happens throughout the books, including creating a swarm of locusts that 
            seperate the three main characters early in the first book.

        <h1>Movie Example: Jurassic World Dominion</h1>
        <br>
        <p>In this movie clip, a swarm of giant locusts descend and attack a local farm, destroying most 
            of the crops, while leaving certain crops intact? As it turns out, these locusts were genetically
            modified and created by Biosyn Genetics and are based on the desert locust and the extinct species 
            of large Maastrichtian-era locust, which increases their size and strength but also makes them unable
            to devour crops engineered by Biosyn Genetics.
        </p>
        <p> As it turns out, these locusts were used for illegal biological warfare against rival Biosyn 
            companies and independent farmers. This scheme is eventually exposed and stopped later in the movie.
            This clip and movie emphasizes not only the danger of locusts but also the dangers of biological
            warfare involving insects and bioweapons.

        <h1>Relgion Example: The Eighth Plague</h1>
        <br>
        <p>"So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the Lord made an east wind blow 
            across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought 
            the locusts; they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country 
            in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will 
            there ever be again. 15 They covered all the ground until it was black. They 
            devoured all that was left after the hailâ€”everything growing in the fields and 
            the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt."</p>
        <h3>Exodus 10: 13-15</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In the bible, when the Pharoah refused to let Moses and the slaves go, God made the plague 
            of locusts happen. Some speculate that the plague of locusts was not only against Pharoah 
            and Egypt but also against the Egyptian God Senehem, a god with a locust head that was 
            supposed to to protect Egypt from such pests.</p>
